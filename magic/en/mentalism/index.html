        <em class="intro"><span class="first-cap">M</span>entalism is a form of magic</em>
         that simulates super-natural phenom&shy;ena such as mind reading,
         psycho&shy;kinesis, predic&shy;tions, clair&shy;voyance, and thought control.
      </p>

      <p>
         A mentalist uses esentially the same tech&shy;niques as
         more tradi&shy;tional magicians and illu&shy;sionists.
         Mentalists, however, often claim to use hypnosis,
         body language, intui&shy;tion, sublim&shy;inal influence,
         <span class="smaller">NLP</span>
         (neuro-linguistic program&shy;ming) or the like.
      </p>

      <p>
         This is almost never true,
         but should be seen as part of the perfor&shy;mance,
         a kind of “fakelore” created to enhance the ambi&shy;ence
         and boost the artist's reputation.
      </p>

      <p>
        Compare with artists who come “directly from Las Vegas.”
        This usually means that they’ve been to Las Vegas at least once.
        If they did some karaoke singing as well,
        the international career is a fact in the press release.
      </p>

      <p>
        The techniques actually used by mentalists are
        rarely more exciting than peeking at a piece of paper.
        This is not mean to belittle the art.
        On the contrary, it takes a lot to present such a simple scam
        as a supposed miracle, and turn it into good entertainment.
      </p>

      <p>
        For those who are interested in the techniques
        used by mentalists, I can recommend
        <em>13 Steps to Mentalism</em>
        (Corinda&nbsp;<span class="smaller">1958</span>).
        The book is old but the principles are still basically the same,
        just minor details have changed.
      </p>

    <h2 class="break">Truth and lies in marketing</h2>

      <p>
        Is mentalism entertainment or is it fraud?
        Where is the boundary between make-believe and deception?
        Let me give an example.
      </p>

      <p>
        The British mentalist Derren Brown presented mentalism
        in a partly new way in the TV series <em>Mind Control</em>.
        The produc&shy;tion company, Objective Produc&shy;tions, utilized
        the television medium’s full potential and mixed enter&shy;tainment
        with alleged documentary.
      </p>

      <p>
        In many scenes it was suggested that Brown
        made use of subliminal influence and body language
        to read minds and influence people
        to do things against their will.
        Although the program was meant as entertainment,
        many were fooled into believing in a false model of explanation.
      </p>

      <p>
        The author Simon Singh thought enough was enough
        when Channel Four promoted the show on their science site,
        and wrote an article (Singh&nbsp;<span class="smaller">2003</span>)
        where he revealed some of the secrets.
        Singh’s article gives a balanced picture of how mentalism works
        and he poses interesting questions about the contract between
        a mentalist and his audience.
      </p>

      <p>
        In Objective Production’s more recent TV shows
        a new path has been chosen and now mentalism is presented
        in a manner reminiscent of Randi’s performances –
        a demon&shy;stration of the techniques that scammers use to trick us.
      </p>

      <p>
        I find it interesting that this type of
        fictional documentary can affect us so strongly.
        I’ve met people with a good knowledge of both magic and media
        who do not fully understand that Derren Brown
        is a character in a TV show and not a real person.
      </p>

      <p>
        Also in stage performances mentalism is presented
        in very different ways.
      </p>

      <p>
        Some mentalists, for example Max Maven, Banachek,
        and Richard Osterlind, have a clear contract with the audience,
        which shows that this is entertainment.
      </p>

      <p>
        Other mentalists choose to express themselves ambiguously
        and doesn’t seem to mind that the audience interprets
        their performance as an example of psychological techniques
        or supernatural abilities.
      </p>

      <p class="break">
       In the <span class="smaller">U.S.</span>
       there are a large number of mentalists
       who push the ethical boundaries.
       It’s not uncommon for a “motivational speaker”
       to spice up his presentation with mentalism.
      </p>

      <p>
        Many performers have raised their fees and prestige
        consid&shy;erably
        by selling their act as a serious talk.
        They claim to use psychological techniques that
        the participants could learn themselves.
        Many companies are willing to pay much higher
        amounts of money for this type of presentation
        than for the same entertainment.
      </p>

      <p>
        Mentalism is clearly used for purely fraudulent purposes.
        Uri Geller, for example, managed to deceive a large part
        of the English speaking world of his supernatural abilities
        by using mentalism techniques.
      </p>

    <h2>Readings</h2>

      <p>
        One particularly nasty variant of mentalism is called readings.
        Here, the mentalist plays the role of a psychic and
        provides answers and advice on sensitive issues, often in private.        
        Some&shy;times pure conjuring techniques are used, but also
        a form of insidious questions and state&shy;ments known as cold reading.
        Ian Rowland gives a detailed and insightful discussion of this in
        <em>The Full Facts Book of Cold Reading</em>
        (Rowland&nbsp;<span class="smaller">2002</span>).
      </p>

      <p>
        False psychics who use conjuring techniques sometimes
        call themselves “open eye”, as opposed to “shut eye”,
        those who themselves believe in their abilities.
      </p>

      <p class="break">
        I have read several of the books and booklets
        circulating among “open eye” psychics.
        They sometimes describe their activities as a form of therapy.
        The texts, however, are exclusively about how to keep
        your back covered and avoid being caught,
        never about the risks you might expose your clients to.
      </p>

      <p>
        However, most psychics do not use conjuring techniques
        and many probably believe in their own ability.
      </p>

      <p>
        There are a plenty of performers who present mentalism
        in a lecture format and the boundary between
        make-believe and deception is often hard to draw.
        Maybe that's part of
        the fascination.&nbsp;<span id="red-end-mark">♦</span>
